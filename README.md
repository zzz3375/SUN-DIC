# SUN-DIC

### Stellenbosch University Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Code


SUN-DIC is an open-source Python package for **2D digital image correlation (DIC)** developed at **Stellenbosch University**. It provides both a **graphical user interface (GUI)** and a **Python API** for displacement and strain analysis from image sets, making it suitable for both interactive use and research workflows.

## Key Features

- Fully open-source, using standard Python libraries wherever possible
- Provides both a user-friendly GUI and a programmable API
- Implements the **Zero-Mean Normalized Sum of Squared Differences (ZNSSD)** correlation criterion
- Uses an advanced starting strategy based on the **AKAZE** feature detection algorithm for initial guess generation
- Supports both **linear (affine)** and **quadratic** shape functions
- Includes **Inverse Compositional Gauss-Newton (IC-GN)** and **Inverse Compositional Levenberg-Marquardt (IC-LM)** solvers
- Provides both **absolute** and **relative** update strategies for handling multiple image pairs
- Supports rectangular regions of interest (ROI) and custom ROIs defined by a black/white mask
- Automatically ignores subsets with an all-black background, allowing irregularly shaped domains to be handled naturally
- Computes **displacements** and **strains**, with multiple plotting and visualization options
- Uses **Savitzky-Golay smoothing** for strain calculations, with optional displacement smoothing using the same algorithm
- Supports parallel computing for improved performance
- Easy installation via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/SUN-DIC/)

---

## Limitations

- Currently supports **2D planar** DIC problems only
- A stereo / 3D version is under development


---

## Installation

Although SUN-DIC can be installed without creating a virtual environment, using one is strongly recommended for easier dependency management.

> **Note** The `ray` library providing the parallel computing functionality is typically not supported for the latest Python releases on Windows. If you run into a `ray` dependency issue during installation, please try an older version of Python.

### 🍎 Note for Apple Silicon Users (Mac M1/M2/M3)

If you are installing SUN-DIC on a Mac equipped with an Apple Silicon processor, using the standard Anaconda distribution may cause version conflicts or C++ compilation errors (e.g., with `llvmlite` or `ray`). This is typically due to Anaconda defaulting to x86_64 emulation.

To ensure a seamless, native ARM64 installation **without needing to modify the `requirements.txt` file**, it is highly recommended to use **[Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)** instead of Anaconda. 

**Setup instructions for Apple Silicon:**
1. Install the macOS arm64 version of Miniforge.
2. Open a new terminal to ensure Miniforge is active (you should see the base environment).
3. Proceed with the standard installation using `conda` as described below.

### General Steps

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Activate the environment
3. Install the package from PyPI
4. Optionally install Jupyter dependencies
5. Copy the example problem into your current directory using `copy-examples`
   
   > Optionally you can issue the `copy-examples --manual` command to also copy the user manual to your current directory

   The example problem includes:

   - `test_sundic.ipynb`
   - `settings.ini`
   - `planar_images/`

   These files provide a practical starting point for both the GUI and API workflows.

### Using `pip`

1. Create a virtual environment (e.g., `sundic`):

   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv sundic
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   
   **Linux / macOS**
   ```bash
   source sundic/bin/activate
   ```

   **Windows (Command Prompt)**
   ```bash
   sundic\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the base package:

   ```bash
   pip install SUN-DIC
   ```

4. Optional -- install Jupyter notebook support:

   ```bash
   pip install "SUN-DIC[jupyter]"
   ```

5. Copy the example problem:

   ```bash
   copy-examples
   ```

---

### Using `conda`

1. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.11:

   ```bash
   conda create -n sundic python=3.11
   ```

2. Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate sundic
   ```

3. Install the base package:

   ```bash
   pip install SUN-DIC
   ```

4. Optional -- install Jupyter notebook support:

   ```bash
   pip install "SUN-DIC[jupyter]"
   ```

5. Copy the example problem:

   ```bash
   copy-examples
   ```

### Installing Directly from GitHub (Advanced Users)

1. Create and activate a virtual environment using either `pip` or `conda` as described above
   
2. Clone the repository and install the package:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gventer/SUN-DIC.git
   pip install ./SUN-DIC
   ```

3. Optional: install Jupyter notebook support:

   ```bash
   pip install "./SUN-DIC[jupyter]"
   ```

4. The example problem is available in:

   ```text
   SUN-DIC/sundic/examples
   ```

---

## Usage

Make sure the virtual environment where `SUN-DIC` is installed is active before proceeding.

### Running the GUI

1. Launch the GUI from a terminal:

   ```bash
   sundic
   ```

2. Use the `copy-examples` command to copy a complete example to your current directory
   
3. In the GUI, use **File → Import Settings File** to import the example `settings.ini`
   
4. Run the example problem from the **Analysis** panel

5. Perform post-processing using the **Results** panel
   
6. Follow the workflow shown on the left-hand side of the GUI

GUI entries include tooltips describing the available options.

### Using the API

1. Use the `copy-examples` command to copy a complete example to your current directory
2. Open `test_sundic.ipynb` for a fully worked example
3. If needed, install the optional Jupyter dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install "SUN-DIC[jupyter]"
   ```

A typical API workflow involves:

- modifying the `settings.ini` file
- running the DIC analysis
- post-processing the results

Although the provided example uses a Jupyter notebook, the API can also be used in standard Python scripts.
